                <p>Gaming is one of my favorite hobbies. I have been gaming since I was around 4 years old and my first console was a Sega Genesis. Gaming is great for me to relax after long days of work, but also can provide a competitive rush when playing online. Having just turned 30, I know many would say I should move on. However I love the hobby and can't see myself not being a gamer even when im old and gray.</p>

                 <p>I have been a employee for the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. for the last 5 years. I knew nothing of tires and cars when I first started, but I have learned a lot and grown in my diligence and communication due to training I have recieved in my time with the compnay.I hope as I move to a new career in programming that some of my skills translate over, but if they don't Im flexible and can adapt to any situation.</p>
